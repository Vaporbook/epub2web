epub2web Epub Reading System
==============================

What it Does
---------------

All-purpose, open source library for Epub content browsing and display. Combines epub-cache with epub2html in order to make Epub content readable via a browser, without special plugins, extensions or hacks.


Installing
---------------

    npm install epub2web


Usage
---------------

See the examples in the test folder. The main test will set up a rudimentary web server to illustrate what's possible. The singlebook variation is to demonstrate how you might serve a single book on one address, and the multibook variation shows how you might add directory indexing to create browsable lists of epub content for a catalog.
